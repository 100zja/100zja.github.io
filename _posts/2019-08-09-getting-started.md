## What is BOF?

**Overflow** : '넘쳐 흐르다.'의 의미   
버퍼 - 지정된 크기의 메모리 공간  
====> 버퍼를 가득 채우다 못해 넘쳐흘러 버퍼 이후의 공간을 침범하는 버그의 일종, 프로그램 취약점    

특정 함수 사용 시 입력한 문자열을 저장하기 위해 선언한 변수 크기보다 길게 입력 시 영역 값 덮어씀   
BOF 공격에 취약한 함수 : strcpy, gets, scanf, strcat, sprintf 등  
---> 처리하는 문자열의 크기를 지정하지 않음  

## Memory structure

메모리는 여러 개의 프로세스가 저장되어 병렬적으로 작업을 수행한다.   
운영 체재 - 하나의 프로세스 실행 시 segment 라는 단위로 묶는다.

Before running or building for the first time, please complete the installation of the Jekyll plugins. Go to the root directory of project and run:

```terminal
$ bundle install
```

`bundle` will automatically install all the dependencies specified by `Gemfile`.

What's more, in order to generate some extra files (*categories*, *tags* and *last modified list*), we need to use some tool scripts. If your machine is running Debian or macOS, make sure that [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) is installed. Otherwise, install by:

* Debian

  ```console
  $ sudo apt-get install coreutils
  ```

* macOS

  ```console
  $ brew install coreutils
  ```


## Register structure

Running [**Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) requires some extra files, which cannot be generated by Jekyll native commands, so please strictly follow the methods mentioned below to run or deploy your website.

## Status Flags

Go to the root directory of the project and start initialization:

```console
$ bash tools/init.sh
```

> If you not intend to deploy it on GitHub Pages, append parameter option `--no-gh` at the end of the above command.

What it does is:

1. Remove some files or directories from your repository:
    - `.travis.yml`
    - files under `_posts`
    - folder `docs` 

2. If you use the `--no-gh` option, the directory `.github` will be deleted. Otherwise, setup the GitHub Action workflow by removing extension `.hook` of `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook`, and then remove the other files and directories in folder `.github`. 

3. Automatically create a commit to save the changes.

## System Flags

Generally, go to `_config.yml` and configure the variables as needed. Some of them are typical options:
* `url`
* `avatar`
* `timezone`
* `theme_mode`


## Instruction Pointer

You may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:

```terminal
$ bash tools/run.sh
```

Then open a browser and visit to <http://localhost:4000>.

Few days later, you may find that the file changes does not refresh in real time by using `run.sh`. Don't worry, the advanced option `-r` (or `--realtime`) will solve this problem, but it requires [**fswatch**](http://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/) to be installed on your machine.

## Assembly Language

Before the deployment begins, checkout the file `_config.yml` and make sure the `url` is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the [_project site_](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites) and don't use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base url on a web server other than **GitHub Pages**, remember to change the `baseurl` to your project name that starting with a slash. For example, `/project`.

Assuming you have already gone through the [initialization](#initialization), you can now choose any of the following methods to deploy your website.

## Prologue & Epilogue

For security reasons, GitHub Pages build runs on `safe` mode, which restricts us from using tool scripts to generate additional page files. Therefore, we can use GitHub Actions to build the site, store the built site files on a new branch, and use that branch as the source of the Pages service.

1. Push any commit to `origin/master` to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the build is complete, a new remote branch called `gh-pages` will appear, which is used to store the built site files.

2. Unless you prefer to project sites, rename your repository to `<username>.github.io` on GitHub.

3. Choose branch `gh-pages` as the [publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) for your GitHub Pages site.

4. Visit your website at the address indicated by GitHub.
